![concourse pipeline](concourse.png)

#HSLIDE

### Why we chose to separate Kafka into a microservice

 * Opportunity to separate out logic
 * Current app is overloaded
 * Difficult to view logs in existing app
 * Challenges of working with new tech
 * Reusability

### What hurt us
    
 * Unfamiliarity with concourse
 * Not using an in memory database
 * Yaml merge conflicts
